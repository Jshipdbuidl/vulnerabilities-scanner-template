# Workshop Steps

## Infrastructure as Code (cloudformation)

1. Github actions pipeline or workflows are define under specific file structure `.github/workflows`. Pipeline is defined on file `ci-iac.yml`, create the file if there is not present: command-line `mkdir -p .github/workflows/` and then `touch .github/workflows/ci-iac.yml`. 
2. Identify programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs by adding Linter or **lint job**.
   1. Copy the following code to pipeline file created:

      ```yml
      name: CI Infra as Code

      on:
        [workflow_dispatch, push]

      concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}

      jobs:

        lint:
          name: CloudFormation Linter
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3
              
            - name: Setup CloudFormation Linter with Latest Version
              uses: scottbrenner/cfn-lint-action@v2

            - name: Lint CloudFormation files.
              run: |
                cfn-lint --version
                cfn-lint -t cfn/*.y*ml -I

      ```

   2. Push your changes.
   3. Check output to identify possible errors. 
   4. Let's fix the warning from the scan job by creating file at repository root level named `.cfnlintrc.yml` or using command-line `touch .cfnlintrc.yml` and add following content:

      ```yml
      ignore_checks:
        - W3002 # This code may only work with `package` cli command as the property (Resources/emailSender/Properties/Code) is a string
      ```

   5. Save and push your changes.

3. Implement Security Scanner: *Aqua Security Trivy*
   1. Add the following code to your pipeline file `ci-iac.yml`:
      ```yml
        trivy:
          name: Run Trivy (Iac and fs mode)
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            # Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Terraform, CloudFormation, Dockerfile and Kubernetes.
            - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner in IaC mode
              uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
              with:
                scan-type: 'config'
                hide-progress: false
                format: 'table'
                exit-code: '1'
                ignore-unfixed: false
                severity: 'UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL'

            - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner in fs mode
              uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
              with:
                scan-type: 'fs'
                hide-progress: false
                format: 'table'
                exit-code: '1'
                ignore-unfixed: false
                severity: 'UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL'
      ```
   2. Save and push your changes.
   3. Check output for possible vulnerabilities.
   4. If pipeline failed for flag: *Image user should not be â€˜rootâ€™* Reference Link: https://avd.aquasec.com/misconfig/ds002
   5. Fix the issue by creating a file named `.trivyignore` at root level of your repository and add the following content:
   
         Reference link: [trivy DS-0002](https://avd.aquasec.com/misconfig/dockerfile/general/avd-ds-0002/)

         ```yml
         # Running containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation. It is a best practice to run containers as non-root users, which can be done by adding a 'USER' statement to the Dockerfile.
         DS002
         ```
   6. Save and push your changes.
   7. Check output pipeline status.
   8. Trivy possibly identified a vulnerability with CVE-2022-42969, you can find more details [HERE](https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2022/cve-2022-42969/). You can deep dive into the subject on your own:
   ![CVE-2022-42969](img/2022-11-17-8-37-59.png)
   For now, let's ignore this flag by changing a value under trivy scanner fs mode code, look for parameter ->> *ignore-unfixed* and set value = true:
      
        ```yml
          - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner in fs mode
            uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
            with:
              scan-type: 'fs'
              hide-progress: false
              format: 'table'
              exit-code: '1'
              ignore-unfixed: true
              severity: 'UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL'
        ```
   <br/>
   <br/>
4. In this step, let's look for patterns in our CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure, we will use ***stelligent/cfn_nag*** in our pipeline for this purpose.
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
      ```yml
        insecure-cf:
          name: Scan Insecure Cloudformation patterns
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Insecure Cloudformation patterns
              uses: stelligent/cfn_nag@master
              with:
                input_path: cfn
                extra_args: --fail-on-warnings

            - name: Fail if cfn_nag scan contains failures, warnings
              # sum cfn_nag failures, warnigns and return it as exit code
              run: |
                exit `grep -E '^(Failures|Warnings)' cfn_nag.out | awk '{ SUM += $3} END { print SUM }'`
      ```
   2. Push your changes.
   3. Check scan resultset, notice the different warinings listed and create a plan of action on a real environment; For now, lets skip the warnings in order to continue.
   ![stelligent warning](img/2022-11-18-12-17-18.png)
   1.  Add an exception file for those warinings at repository root level named `.cfnnagcfg.yml` or using command-line `touch .cfnnagcfg.yml` and add the below rules to supress on scan:
        ```yml
          ---
          RulesToSuppress:
          - id: W2
            reason: Security Groups found with cidr open to world on ingress.  This should never be true on instance.  Permissible on ELB
          - id: W9
            reason: Security Groups found with ingress cidr that is not /32
          - id: W58
            reason: Lambda functions require permission to write CloudWatch Logs
          - id: W92
            reason: Lambda functions should define ReservedConcurrentExecutions to reserve simultaneous executions
          - id: F1000
            reason: Missing egress rule means all traffic is allowed outbound.  Make this explicit if it is desired configuration
        ```
   2. Lets add an additional extra argumement ` --deny-list-path .cfnnagcfg.yml` to the job to consider the exception file:
        ```yml
            - name: Insecure Cloudformation patterns
              uses: stelligent/cfn_nag@master
              with:
                input_path: cfn
                extra_args: --fail-on-warnings --deny-list-path .cfnnagcfg.yml
        ```

    1. Save and Push your changes. 
    2. If no errors, let's continue...
<br/>
<br/>

5. *Checkov*: Policy-as-code. Scans cloud infrastructure configurations to find misconfigurations.
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
      ```yml
        Checkov:
          name: Checkov - Security Analysis of Cloudformation
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Run Checkov action
              id: checkov
              uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
              with:
                directory: cfn/
                quiet: false # optional: display only failed checks
                soft_fail: false # optional: do not return an error code if there are failed checks
                #skip_check: CKV_AWS_115,CKV_AWS_116,CKV_AWS_173,CKV_AWS_260
        ```
    2. Commit and Push your changes.
    3. Static security analysis show diffent validation flags from the scan.
    ![checkov scan](img/2022-11-18-1-38-26.png)
    4. For thew purpose of the demo, we will skip those flags by uncomment the parameter *skip_check* as below:
        ```yml
          - name: Run Checkov action
              id: checkov
              uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
              with:
              directory: cfn/
              quiet: false # optional: display only failed checks
              soft_fail: false # optional: do not return an error code if there are failed checks
              skip_check: CKV_AWS_115,CKV_AWS_116,CKV_AWS_173,CKV_AWS_260
        ```
    5. Save and push your changes.
    5. If no errors, let's continue...
<br/>
<br/>

6. Add final job to validate all previous steps `[checkov,insecure-cf,trivy,lint]` are completed, if any of those fail it will not complete.
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
      ```yml
        deploy:
          name: deploy 
          needs: [checkov,insecure-cf,trivy,lint]
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Deploy the thing
              run: |
                echo Deploying ðŸš€
      ```
<br/>

## Application Code (Backend on Python)

Let's now create our pipeline for CI Backend and explore the different tools that will help you to secure your deployments and pipelines.

1. Let's start by creating our pipeline file `ci-backend.yml` or using command-line `touch .github/workflows/ci-backend.yml` under `.github/workflows`.
2. ***Trufflehog***: is an open source secrets detection engine that finds leaky API keys and passwords
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
      ```yml
        name: CI Backend
        on:
          [workflow_dispatch, push]

        concurrency: ci-backend-${{ github.ref }}

        jobs:

          TruffleHog:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v3
                with:
                  fetch-depth: 0

              - name: trufflehog
                run: |
                  docker run -v ${PWD}:/truffle trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest filesystem --directory="/truffle/"
      ```
3. ***Gitleaks***: This tool helps in detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git.
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
      ```yml
        gitleaks:
          name: gitleaks
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v3
              with:
                fetch-depth: 0
            
            - name: run gitleaks docker
              run: |
                docker run -v ${PWD}:/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect --source="/path/" -v -l debug --no-git
      ```
   2. Gitleaks performs leaks based on regex expressions, you can get more detail by checking file: `.gitleaks.toml`.
   3. Check output to identify possible leaks. As a best practice, never leave secrets exposed, even when those are commented lines, at the end is plain text that can be exploited.
   ![gitleaks results](img/2022-11-18-2-41-39.png)
   1. Check on gitleaks results for parameters found: *Finding*,*Secret*,*File*,*Line*.
   2. Fix flagged code on `lambda.py`, remove commented line that shows #token, and replace secrets value withe string: "test" as per code below (do not copy pointing arrows):
      ```yml
        def get_logs_client():
            """Get AWS logs client either local or real"""

            if IS_DEPLOYMENT:
                return boto3.client("logs", region_name=region_name)
            else:
                return boto3.client(
                    "logs",
                    aws_access_key_id="test", <-----
                    aws_secret_access_key="test", <-----
                    region_name=region_name,
                    endpoint_url="http://localhost:4566",
                )
      ```
    1. Save and push your changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
4. ***PyCharm Security***: This tool allows you to run a security check to your repository.
   1. Add the bellow code to the `ci-backend.yml` file:
      ```yml
        security-checks:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: [gitleaks]
          name: Pycharm-security check
          steps:
            - name: checkout git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Run PyCharm Security
              uses: tonybaloney/pycharm-security@master
      ```
    1. Save and Push your changes.
    2. Check on outputs for Pycharm-security check.
      ![Pycharm results](img/2022-11-16-2-48-13.png)
    3. Please notice that your pipeline continues even when warnings are flagged, if you want to modify this behaviour and force the pipeline to fail, this can be achieved by adding extra argument: `fail_on_warnings` and set that to `true`.
    4. You can explore this on your own; For the purpose of the demo, let's continue...
<br/>
<br/>

5. ***Grype (Anchore)***: Vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems.
   1. Add the bellow code to the `ci-backend.yml` file:
      ```yml
        docker-grype-project:
          name: Grype (Anchore) Project Scan
          needs: [gitleaks]
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Scan current project with Grype (Anchore)
              id: scan-project
              uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
              with:
                path: "."
                fail-build: true
                output-format: table
      ```
   2. Save and push your changes.
   3. Check pipeline output; You should see the below vulnerability found, since we did specify parameter ***fail-build: true*** the job got failed, but you can change this behaviour by setting the value to ***false***.
   ![grype result](img/2022-11-18-4-46-19.png)
   1. Awesome!! Let's continue...
   <br/>
   <br/>
6. Now, lets create your Docker image.
   1. Add docker build job code block to `ci-backend.yml` file:
      ```yml
        docker-build:
          name: Build Docker image
          outputs:
            full_docker_image_tag: ${{ steps.build_image.outputs.full_docker_image_tag }}
            image_tag: ${{ steps.build_image.outputs.image_tag }}
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: [security-checks, trufflehog, docker-grype]
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3

            - name: Add SHORT_SHA and BRANCH_TAG env variables
              run: |
                echo "SHORT_SHA=`echo ${GITHUB_SHA} | cut -c1-8`" >> $GITHUB_ENV
                echo "BRANCH_TAG=`echo ${GITHUB_REF##*/}`" >> $GITHUB_ENV

            - name: Set IMAGE_TAG env variable
              run: |
                echo "IMAGE_TAG=`echo ${BRANCH_TAG}-${SHORT_SHA}`" >> $GITHUB_ENV

            - name: Build and tag image
              id: build_image
              env:
                REGISTRY: ghcr.io
                IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
                ECR_REPOSITORY: ${{ github.repository }}
                IMAGE_TAG: ${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
              run: |
                echo REGISTRY: $REGISTRY
                echo ECR_REPOSITORY: $ECR_REPOSITORY
                echo IMAGE_TAG: $IMAGE_TAG
                echo "Building and tagging $REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG ..."
                docker build -t $REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG -f Dockerfile .
                mkdir -p /tmp
                docker save "$REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG" > /tmp/docker-image.tar
                echo "full_docker_image_tag=$REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
                echo "image_tag=$IMAGE_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

            - name: Upload artifact
              uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
              with:
                name: docker-image
                path: /tmp/docker-image.tar
                retention-days: 1
      ```
7. Lets scan our Docker image for vulnerabilities, add *Docker-trivy-vul* job to pipeline.
   1. Add docker trivy job to `ci-backend.yml` file:
      ```yml
        docker-trivy-vuln:
          name: Trivy vulnerability scanner
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: [docker-build]
          steps:
            - name: Download artifact
              uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
              with:
                name: docker-image
                path: /tmp
            - name: Load Docker image
              run: |
                docker load --input /tmp/docker-image.tar

            - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
              uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
              with:
                image-ref: "${{ needs.docker-build.outputs.full_docker_image_tag }}"
                hide-progress: false
                format: 'table'
                exit-code: '0'
                ignore-unfixed: false
                severity: 'UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL'
      ```
    1. Push your changes.
    2. If no issues, let's continue...
<br/>
<br/>

9. Lets invoke our vulnerability scanner for container images - *Grype*:
    1.  Add below code to our `ci-backend.yml` file:
        ```yml
          docker-grype:
            name: Grype (Anchore) Docker Scan
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            needs: [docker-build]
            steps:
              - name: Download artifact
                uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
                with:
                  name: docker-image
                  path: /tmp

              - name: Load Docker image
                run: |
                  docker load --input /tmp/docker-image.tar

              - name: Scan image wih Grype (Anchore)
                id: scan-image
                uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
                with:
                  image: "${{ needs.docker-build.outputs.full_docker_image_tag }}"
                  fail-build: true
        ```
    2. Push your changes
    3. Check pipeline output; You should see the below vulnerability found, since we did specify parameter `fail-build: true` the job got failed, but you can change this behaviour by setting the value to `false`.
    4. If no issues, let's continue..

1. Our final step is a validation job which depends on previous security scans in order to complete:
    1. Add the below job and push your changes:
      ```yml
        deploy:
          name: Push 
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: [docker-grype,docker-trivy-vuln]
          steps:
            - name: Deploy the thing
              run: |
                echo Deploying ðŸš€
      ```
2. If pipeline succeeded, you are all set!!!!!!
3. Happy deploy... ðŸš€
