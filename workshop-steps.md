# Workshop Steps

## Infrastructure as Code (cloudformation)

1. Github actions pipeline or workflows are define under specific file structure `.github/workflows`. Pipeline is defined on file `ci-iac.yml`, create the file if there is no present: `touch .github/workflows/ci-iac.yml` . 
2. Identify programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs by adding Linter or **lint job**.
   1. Copy the following code to pipeline file created:

      ```yml
      name: CI Infra as Code

      on:
        [workflow_dispatch, push]

      concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}

      jobs:

        lint:
          name: CloudFormation Linter
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Check out Git repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v3
              
            - name: Setup CloudFormation Linter with Latest Version
              uses: scottbrenner/cfn-lint-action@v2

            - name: Lint CloudFormation files.
              run: |
                cfn-lint --version
                cfn-lint -t cfn/*.y*ml -I

      ```

   2. Push your changes.
   3. Check output to identify possible errors. 
   4. Fix the issue by creating `.cfnlintrc.yml` with the following content:

      ```yml
      ignore_checks:
        - W3002 # This code may only work with `package` cli command as the property (Resources/emailSender/Properties/Code) is a string
      ```

   5. Save and push your changes
3. Implement Security Scanner: *Tryvy*
      1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
      ```yml
      trivy:
        name: Run Trivy (Iac and fs mode)
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Check out Git repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v3

          # Trivy scans Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Terraform, CloudFormation, Dockerfile and Kubernetes.
          - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner in IaC mode
            uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
            with:
              scan-type: 'config'
              hide-progress: false
              format: 'table'
              exit-code: '1'
              ignore-unfixed: false
              severity: 'UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL'

          - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner in fs mode
            uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
            with:
              scan-type: 'fs'
              hide-progress: false
              format: 'table'
              exit-code: '1'
              ignore-unfixed: true
              severity: 'UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL'
      ```
4. Let's look for patterns in CloudFormation templates that may indicate insecure infrastructure.
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
   ```yml
    insecure-cf:
      name: Scan Insecure Cloudformation patterns
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Check out Git repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Insecure Cloudformation patterns
          uses: stelligent/cfn_nag@master
          with:
            input_path: cfn
            extra_args: --fail-on-warnings --blacklist-path .cfnnagcfg.yml

        - name: Fail if cfn_nag scan contains failures, warnings
          # sum cfn_nag failures, warnigns and return it as exit code
          run: |
            exit `grep -E '^(Failures|Warnings)' cfn_nag.out | awk '{ SUM += $3} END { print SUM }'`
   ```
5. *Checkov*: Policy-as-code .
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
   ```yml
    Checkov:
      name: Checkov - Security Analysis of Cloudformation
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Check out Git repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v3

        - name: Run Checkov action
          id: checkov
          uses: bridgecrewio/checkov-action@master
          with:
            directory: cfn/
            quiet: false # optional: display only failed checks
            soft_fail: false # optional: do not return an error code if there are failed checks
            skip_check: CKV_AWS_115,CKV_AWS_116,CKV_AWS_173,CKV_AWS_260
            # framework: cloudformation # optional: run only on a specific infrastructure {cloudformation,terraform,kubernetes,all}
            # output_format: json # optional: the output format, one of: cli, json, junitxml, github_failed_only
            # download_external_modules: true # optional: download external terraform modules from public git repositories and terraform registry
            # # log_level: DEBUG # optional: set log level. Default WARNING
            # baseline: cloudformation/.checkov.baseline # optional: Path to a generated baseline file. Will only report results not in the baseline.
    ```
  
6. Add last step to validate all previous steps are completed `[checkov,insecure-cf,trivy,lint]`, if any of those fail it will not complete.
   1. Add the following code to pipeline file created:
   ```yml
    deploy:
      name: deploy 
      needs: [checkov,insecure-cf,trivy,lint]
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Deploy the thing
          run: |
            echo Deploying ðŸš€
   ```
